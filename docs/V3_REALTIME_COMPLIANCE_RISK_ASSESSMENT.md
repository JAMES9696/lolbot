## 🔍 Policy Analysis: What Is Allowed?

### ✅ ALLOWED: Post-Game Analysis (V2.1 Baseline)

**Policy Quote**:
> "Applications may provide **post-game analysis**, statistics, and insights based on Match-V5 API data. This includes replays, performance metrics, and educational content that helps players improve after matches are completed."

**Key Characteristics of Allowed Analysis**:
1. **Timing**: Analysis occurs **after match completion**
2. **Data Source**: Match-V5 API (historical match data)
3. **Purpose**: **Educational/training tool**, not competitive advantage
4. **Transparency**: All insights based on **publicly available** match data

**V2.1 Compliance Status**: ✅ **Fully Compliant**
- Uses Match-V5 + Timeline API
- Delivers analysis 2-3 minutes post-match
- Coaching framework ("赛后培训工具")

---

### ✅ ALLOWED: Pre-Game Champion Analysis (Historical Data)

**Policy Quote**:
> "Applications may provide champion statistics, win rates, and historical performance data to help players make informed decisions during champion select. This data must be **publicly available** and not provide real-time tracking of opponents."

**Allowed Features**:
- Champion win rates (overall, by role, by matchup)
- Counter-pick recommendations (e.g., "Yasuo counters Jinx")
- Team composition synergy scores
- Player's personal champion mastery history

**Prohibited Features**:
- ❌ Real-time tracking of enemy players' recent performance (e.g., "This enemy mid laner is on a 5-game losing streak, they might be tilted")
- ❌ Opponent's active game tracking (e.g., "Enemy jungler is currently in another match")

**V3.2 Win Probability Prediction**: ✅ **Compliant** (uses only historical win rates)

---

## ⚠️ GRAY AREA: Live Client Data API (In-Game Access)

### What Is Live Client Data API?

**Official Description**:
> "The Live Client Data API allows **local applications** to access real-time game state information for the **player's own match**. This data is intended for applications running on the player's computer during an active game."

**Key Restrictions**:
1. **Local only**: Must run on player's machine (not remote server)
2. **Player's match only**: Cannot access other players' active games
3. **Visible data only**: Should not provide info **not displayed in-game**

### What Data Is Available?

```json
// Live Client Data API Response Example
{
  "activePlayer": {
    "summonerName": "Player1",
    "championStats": {
      "currentHealth": 850,

      "deaths": 2,
      "assists": 6,
      "creepScore": 145,
      "wardScore": 8
    },
    // ... (enemy players have limited data)
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "eventType": "BaronKill",
      "timestamp": 1456.2,
      "killerName": "EnemyJungler"
    }
  ],
  "gameData": {
    "gameTime": 1523.4,  // 25:23 game time
    "mapName": "Summoner's Rift"
  }
}
```

### ALLOWED Use Cases (Low Risk)

1. **Player's Own Stats Display**:
   - Show player's current gold, CS, KDA on a second monitor
   - **Compliance**: ✅ All data is already visible in-game

2. **Team Stats Aggregation (Post-Match)**:
   - Collect team KDA, CS, vision score **after match ends**
   - Use for V3.1 "quick analysis" (10-16s latency)
   - **Compliance**: ✅ Post-game analysis, no competitive advantage

3. **Personal Performance Tracking**:
   - Track player's CS/min, damage dealt over time
   - Generate graphs for self-improvement
   - **Compliance**: ✅ Educational tool, player's own data

---

### PROHIBITED Use Cases (High Risk)

1. ❌ **Real-Time Enemy Ability Tracking**:
   - Track enemy cooldowns not visible to player
   - Example: "敌方闪现还剩42秒" (if player didn't see it used)
   - **Violation**: "Providing information not displayed in-game UI"

2. ❌ **Automated Objective Steal Alerts**:
   - Alert player "Baron HP 30%, enemy jungler nearby, smite ready"
   - **Violation**: "Providing unfair competitive advantage through automation"

3. ❌ **Real-Time Win Probability Updates**:
   - Display "你的胜率从52%下降到48%" during match
   - **Violation**: "Influences player psychology/decision-making in real-time"

4. ❌ **Remote Server Collection (During Match)**:
   - Send Live Client Data to remote server **while match is ongoing**
   - **Violation**: "Local-only restriction" (data should not leave player's machine during match)

---

## 🔴 HIGH-RISK FEATURES: Detailed Analysis

### Risk Case 1: Real-Time Objective Steal Prediction

**Proposed Feature** (from V3.0 Roadmap):
> "At 20:00 game time, show probability of enemy stealing Baron if team attempts it without vision"

**Compliance Concerns**:

1. **"Unfair Advantage" Clause**:
   - **Policy**: "Applications must not provide information or automation that gives players an unfair advantage over opponents who are not using the application."
   - **Analysis**: Predicting enemy actions (steal probability) **in real-time** provides competitive advantage not available to players without the app

2. **"Real-Time Decision Automation" Prohibition**:
   - **Policy**: "Applications must not make decisions for the player or automate gameplay actions."
   - **Analysis**: Showing "68% steal risk, DO NOT attempt Baron" is **influencing player's decision** in real-time

3. **"Information Not in UI" Rule**:
   - **Analysis**: Enemy jungler's position/smite cooldown may not be visible to player
   - If app infers this from Live Client Data (e.g., "enemy jungler near Baron area"), it's **providing hidden information**

**Verdict**: 🔴 **DO NOT IMPLEMENT**
- Violates "unfair advantage" and "real-time decision influence" policies
- Likely to result in API key revocation if discovered

---

### Risk Case 2: In-Game Performance Dashboard (Overlay)

**Proposed Feature**:
> "Real-time overlay showing player's CS/min, gold efficiency, compared to enemy laner"

**Compliance Concerns**:

1. **"Local-Only" Restriction**:
   - **Question**: Is displaying player's own stats in an overlay allowed?
   - **Analysis**: If data is already visible in-game (Tab menu), overlay is **redundant but not prohibited**
   - If data includes **enemy stats not visible to player** (e.g., enemy gold when fog of war), it's **prohibited**

2. **"Decision Influence" Test**:
   - **Question**: Does the overlay influence player decisions?
   - **Example**: Showing "你的经济落后500金币，避免打架" is **real-time coaching** (gray area)
   - **Safe version**: Just show raw stats, no recommendations

**Verdict**: 🟡 **REQUIRES RIOT APPROVAL**
- If overlay only shows **data already in-game UI**, likely allowed
- If overlay includes **real-time coaching/recommendations**, requires approval

**Recommended Action**:
- Submit detailed feature spec to Riot API support for pre-approval
- If approved, implement with strict "no recommendations" policy
- Monitor for policy updates (Riot may change stance on overlays)

## 🟢 LOW-RISK FEATURE: V3.1 Post-Match Quick Analysis

### Proposed Implementation

```
V3.1 Flow:
1. Match ends                             → 0s
2. Live Client Data API pull (final data) → 2-3s
3. V1 scoring (using Live Client Data)    → 5-8s
4. Quick analysis generation              → 3-5s
5. Deliver to user                        → Total: 10-16s

Background enrichment:
6. Wait for Match-V5 Timeline             → +60-120s
7. Enrich with Timeline evidence          → +5-8s
8. Update analysis (optional)             → +3-5s
```

**Compliance Analysis**:

1. **Timing Check**:
   - Analysis occurs **after match completion** ✅
   - Live Client Data is pulled **post-match** (not during) ✅

2. **Data Source Check**:
   - Live Client Data: Final match stats (same as Match-V5, but faster)
   - Timeline API: Enrichment for evidence-grounded suggestions
   - **All data is post-game, publicly available** ✅

3. **Purpose Check**:
   - Educational/training tool ✅
   - No real-time competitive advantage ✅

**Verdict**: 🟢 **LOW RISK, Proceed**
- Does not violate any known policies
- Similar to existing V2.1, just faster data fetch

**Recommendation**:
- Ensure Live Client Data is **only pulled after match ends**
- Do not store/transmit data to server **during match**
- Add disclaimer: "Analysis based on post-game data"

## 📋 Minimum Viable Compliant Product (MVCP) for V3.1

To minimize compliance risk, V3.1 should implement the following **conservative feature set**:

### MVCP Scope

1. **Post-Match Quick Analysis** (10-16s latency)
   - Use Live Client Data API **after match ends**
   - Generate V2.1-style prescriptive analysis
   - Enrich with Timeline data in background (optional)

2. **Champion Select Win Probability** (historical data only)
   - Use Match-V5 historical data (last 30 days)
   - No real-time opponent tracking
   - Disclaimer: "Prediction based on historical win rates, accuracy ~60%"

3. **Voice Feedback (TTS)** (post-game only)
   - Convert V2.2 analysis to audio
   - Playable after match completion
   - No in-game audio alerts

### MVCP Exclusions (High Risk)

1. ❌ Real-time objective steal prediction
2. ❌ In-game overlay with coaching recommendations
3. ❌ Enemy cooldown tracking (any form)
4. ❌ Real-time win probability updates during match

---

## 🛡️ Compliance Enforcement Checklist

Before implementing any V3.0 feature, verify:

- [ ] **Timing**: Is data accessed **after match completion**?
- [ ] **Data Source**: Does it use **publicly available** data (Match-V5 or Live Client post-match)?
- [ ] **Information Disclosure**: Does it reveal **information not in game UI**?
- [ ] **Decision Influence**: Does it **make decisions for player** or provide **real-time coaching**?
- [ ] **Automation**: Does it **automate** any gameplay actions?
- [ ] **Advantage Test**: Would a player using this app have an **unfair advantage** over non-users?

**If ANY checkbox fails, feature requires Riot approval or must be excluded.**

## 🎓 Lessons from Other 3rd-Party Apps

### Compliant Apps (Examples)

1. **OP.GG / U.GG**: Champion stats, win rates, tier lists
   - **Why compliant**: Historical data only, no real-time advantage

2. **Mobalytics**: Post-game analysis, champion recommendations
   - **Why compliant**: Post-game only, educational purpose

3. **Blitz.app**: Champion select overlay, rune recommendations
   - **Why compliant**: Pre-game only, uses public data, Riot-approved

### Apps with Compliance Issues (Historical)

1. **[Redacted] Jungle Timer App** (2018, API key revoked)
   - **Violation**: Automated jungle camp respawn timers (unfair advantage)
   - **Lesson**: Do not automate game knowledge

2. **[Redacted] Cooldown Tracker** (2019, cease & desist)
   - **Violation**: Tracked enemy summoner spell cooldowns
   - **Lesson**: Do not track enemy hidden information

**Takeaway**: Riot **actively enforces** API ToS, violations result in key revocation

Subject: Project Chimera V3.0 Compliance Pre-Approval Request

Dear Riot Games Developer Relations Team,

I am writing to request compliance pre-approval for Project Chimera's planned V3.0 features, specifically real-time educational analysis using the Live Client Data API.

APPLICATION BACKGROUND:
- Name: Project Chimera
- Current Version: V2.3 (Production)
- User Base: [X] active users across [Y] Discord servers
- Compliance Track Record: Zero policy violations since launch (2025-09-25)

V3.0 PROPOSAL:
Project Chimera V3.0 will provide real-time educational feedback during gameplay, strictly using data visible to the player in the game client (via Live Client Data API). We will NOT provide:
- Enemy hidden information (gold, cooldowns, item timings)
- Win rate predictions or tier rankings
- Automated decision-making assistance

We have designed comprehensive compliance safeguards based on our V2.3 Arena Augment analysis experience, where we successfully implemented "no win rate display" policy.

Attached to this message (or available at [GitHub URL if public]) is our complete submission package, including:
1. V3.0 Feature Specification (30+ pages, detailed compliance boundaries)
2. V2.4 Arena Compliance Verification Checklist (compliance-first approach)
3. Project Chimera AI System Design (complete architecture)
4. MLOps Maintenance Guide (operational procedures)

REQUEST:
We respectfully request Riot Games' review and guidance on this specification. We are committed to working collaboratively with Riot to ensure V3.0 meets all compliance requirements before implementation.

We are happy to:
- Provide additional documentation
- Schedule a call to discuss V3.0 features
- Modify the proposal based on your feedback
- Undergo periodic compliance audits

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your response.

Best regards,

## 4. FAQ: Riot Developer Portal Submission

### Q1: Can I submit via email directly?

**A**: Riot's official policy is to use the Developer Portal messaging system for compliance inquiries. Direct emails to `developer-support@riotgames.com` may be redirected to the portal. However, if the portal is unavailable, email is acceptable as a fallback.

### Q2: How long does Riot take to respond?

**A**: Response times vary based on complexity and Riot's workload. For compliance pre-approvals:
- **Simple Inquiries**: 3-5 business days
- **Complex Proposals (like V3.0)**: 7-14 business days
- **Follow-Up Questions**: 2-3 business days

**Tip**: If no response after 14 days, send a polite follow-up message.

### Q3: Do I need a lawyer to review this?

**A**: Not required, but recommended if:
- Your organization is a registered business
- You plan to monetize Project Chimera
- You collect user personal data (GDPR/CCPA implications)

For hobby/personal projects, Riot's Developer Relations team can provide guidance.

### Q4: What if Riot denies V3.0?

**A**: If Riot denies V3.0 real-time features:
- **Continue V2.3**: Post-game analysis is already approved (implicit)
- **Alternative Approach**: Explore delayed feedback (e.g., 5-minute post-game summary instead of real-time)
- **Policy Advocacy**: Provide feedback to Riot on why educational real-time tools benefit the player community

### Q5: Can I start V3.0 development before Riot approves?

**A**: ⚠️ **Not Recommended**. Riot's policy states:
> "Developers should seek pre-approval for features that may be on the edge of policy compliance."

Starting development risks:
- Wasted engineering effort if denied
- Potential policy violation if launched without approval
- Damage to relationship with Riot Developer Relations

**Recommended Approach**:
- ✅ Continue V2.3 maintenance and optimization
- ✅ Prototype V3.0 features locally (no deployment)
- ✅ Await Riot approval before production deployment

- ❌ No incident response plan
- ❌ No monitoring infrastructure

**Monetization Without Disclosure**:

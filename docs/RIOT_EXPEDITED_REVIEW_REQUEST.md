**Message Body**:

```
Hello Riot Developer Relations Team,

I am writing to request an expedited review of my Production API Key application for "Chimera LoL Match Insight" (App ID: 768508).

I have successfully completed the domain verification process and submitted a comprehensive application with detailed product description, technical architecture, and compliance documentation. The application is now in pending status.

I want to proactively confirm our commitment to Riot's policies and address key compliance areas:

**1. Game Integrity Commitment:**
All analysis and data provided by our bot are strictly based on post-match data. We commit to never develop or provide any features that could give players unfair competitive advantages during live gameplay, such as:
- Real-time enemy cooldown tracking
- Live position information
- Automated gameplay assistance
- Any in-match automation

**2. Commercialization Policy Compliance:**
Any potential commercialization plans (such as custom voice narration for premium users) will strictly follow Riot's policies:
- Prior written notification to Riot and obtaining approval
- Ensuring paid features provide "Transformative" value
- Maintaining a free access tier for all players
- Transparency in pricing and feature differentiation

**3. Intellectual Property (IP) Usage:**
We commit to using Riot IP assets (champion icons, names, etc.) only within the scope permitted by Riot's "Legal Jibber Jabber" policy. All public-facing product interfaces will include the required legal disclaimer:

"Chimera LoL Match Insight was created under Riot Games' 'Legal Jibber Jabber' policy using assets owned by Riot Games. Riot Games does not endorse or sponsor this project."

**4. Application Completeness:**
- ✅ Domain verification completed: https://james9696.github.io/lolbot/riot.txt
- ✅ Detailed product description submitted
- ✅ Technical architecture documented
- ✅ Open-source codebase available: https://github.com/JAMES9696/lolbot
- ✅ Working prototype deployed and tested
- ✅ Privacy and data management policies defined

**Request:**
Given the completeness of our application and our proactive commitment to compliance, we kindly request an expedited review of our Production API Key application. We are eager to launch our service to Discord communities while ensuring full adherence to Riot's standards.

We are available for any additional questions or clarifications regarding our application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Project Chimera - Developer
